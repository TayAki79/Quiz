NEW!!! a meta tag with a "description" value for the "name" attribute. This is followed by the "content" attribute which value is just a short description of the site. This tag is important for accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

UI (User Interface) components need a role, a name and sometimes a value for people who are using assistive technologies like screen readers, switch controls and speech recognition software.
An important accessibility principle is that a custom control needs a role, a name and sometimes a value.
The region role points to a specific area (region) of page.

A common pattern to visually hide text for only screen readers to read:
          position: absolute;
          width: 1px;
          height: 1px;
          padding: 0;
          margin: -1px;
          overflow: hidden;
          clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
          white-space: nowrap;
          border: 0;
